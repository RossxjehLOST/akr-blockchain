# Akr-Blockchain
When I wrote this code, only god and I knew how it worked.
Now, only god knows it.   
Good luck reading this garbage.  

In all seriousnes, this was the worst task in AKR yet. As a person with zero knowledge with Python, they expected me to code something like this from a scrath with scuffed tutorial and no help from teacher whatsoever. No thanks, didn't learn anything. Only how to copy code from my classmates that also had no idea what they were doing.
